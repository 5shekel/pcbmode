{"name":"PCBmodE","tagline":"A printed circuit board design tool with a twist","body":"## PCBmodE\r\n\r\nPCBmodE is a printed circuit board design Python script that creates an SVG from JSON input files, and then creates Gerber and Excellon files for manufacturing. \r\n\r\nPCBmodE gives the designer the freedome to place any arbitrary shape on any layer, as it is natively vector-based. Much of the design is done in a text editor -- editing JSON -- with viewing and some editing -- routing mostly -- done with Inkscape.\r\n\r\n### The name\r\nThe 'mod' in PCBmodE has a double meaning. The first is short for 'modern' (in contrast to tired old EDA tools). The second is a play on the familiar 'modifications' or 'mods' done to imperfect PCBs. Call it 'PCB mode' or 'PCB mod E', whichever you prefer. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
