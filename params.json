{"name":"PCBmodE","tagline":"A printed circuit board design tool with a twist","body":"## PCBmodE\r\nPCBmodE is a printed circuit board design Python script that creates an SVG from [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) input files, and then creates [Gerber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerber_format) and Excellon files for manufacturing. \r\n\r\nPCBmodE gives the designer the freedome to place any arbitrary shape on any layer, as it is natively vector-based. Much of the design is done in a text editor -- editing JSON -- with viewing and some editing -- routing mostly -- done with [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org).\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nYou'll need:\r\n* Python 2.7\r\n* [PyParsing](http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/)\r\n* [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org)\r\n\r\nPCBmodE is developed and tested under Linux, so it might or might not work under other OSs. (It'd be helpful to know success or failure of attempts!)\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n[Documentation](http://pcbmode.readthedocs.org)  \r\n[Boards repository](https://github.com/boldport/PCBmodE-boards)\r\n\r\n### The name\r\nThe 'mod' in PCBmodE has a double meaning. The first is short for 'modern' (in contrast to tired old EDA tools). The second is a play on the familiar 'modifications' or 'mods' done to imperfect PCBs. Call it 'PCB mode' or 'PCB mod E', whichever you prefer. \r\n\r\n### License\r\nPCBmodE versions 3.0 and above are licensed under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
